# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

## Introduction
In TypeScript, **Union** and **Intersection** types are essential features that provide flexibility and safety to the type system. They enable developers to represent multiple types (Union) or combine types (Intersection), adding robustness to code.

## What Are Union Types?
Union types allow a variable to hold values of different types. They are defined using the `|` operator. For example, `string | number` means a variable can be either a `string` or a `number`.

### Example:
```typescript
function formatValue(value: string | number) {
    return `Formatted: ${value}`;
}
```

## What Are Intersection Types?
Intersection types are used to combine multiple types into one. They are defined using the `&` operator, requiring a variable to fulfill all combined types' properties.

### Example:
```typescript
type Product = { name: string; price: number };
type DetailedProduct = Product & { reviews: string[] };
```

## Conclusion
Union and Intersection types are powerful tools in TypeScript, offering type safety and flexibility that makes handling complex data structures easy. They ensure efficient, error-free code by enabling precise type-checking and validation.
